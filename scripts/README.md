# Publishing scripts

This folder is of real use only to the maintainers of OpenSecOps products, 
but do feel free take a look.

Don't put anything in this folder, as it will be deleted and recreated
whenever development and deployment scripts are updated. If you need to
add scripts of your own, use a dedicated folder.
